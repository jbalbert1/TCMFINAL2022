# TCMFINAL2022

Our final project uses Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze past data and predict future performance of golf players. To start, we looked at the 2022 strokes gained thus far for four different strokes: off the tee, approaching the green, around the green, and putting. Looking at each stroke separately, we sorted the players from best score to worst score, and then used min-max scaling to get each score on a scale from zero (worst) to one (best). We compiled these scores for the four strokes into one master table. We then did the exact same process using 2021 statistics. Next, we were interested in finding the contributions of each stroke in final performance. To do this, we ran a linear regression to get the coefficients for each stroke. It was important to keep in mine that those coefficients with the lowest number (most negative) would lead to the highest contribution because better golf scores are lower. From there, we put each coefficient over the total to get the contributions of each stroke. Finally, to get a final score, we calculated a weighted average for each player using their scores and the contributions for each stroke. We then sorted the players by this final score, creating a predictive leaderboard.
